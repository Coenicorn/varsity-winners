# Varsity Winners

The [Varsity](https://knsrb.nl/varsity/) is a historic Dutch rowing event during which the top college crews from all over the country compete to win the 'Oude Vier' (the top men's [coxed four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxed_four)).

The first edition of this event was held in 1878, and it's consistently been rowed ever since. Winning the Varsity is truly something remarkable, and a major goal for every college rower. Many of the great olympic rowers of the Netherlands have won it, and have stated that the event carries the same weight as even major international races.

As such, rowers who have won this race may not be forgotten. That's the philosophy behind this repository.

## Gratitude

A major part of this project would not have been possible if not for some sources who have collected extensive data on older editions of the Varsity, data that even transcends the scope of this data set. Thanks to them!

Here are those sources if you want to have a look yourself:

## Contributing

As in any historical dataset, additional data is always highly appreciated. If you know something about any specific editions of the Varsity that might be of value, open an issue and we can improve this data set together! If you want to contribute directly, open a pull request!

Trivia and fun facts are always appreciated aswell!

Important points of improvement:

* Most of the names in this document are abbreviated, because the main source I used for the majority of the names does so. If you know any of the names, please change them to the non-abbreviated versions and submit a pull request!
