# Varsity Winners

The Varsity is a dutch rowing event where the top
boats from dutch college rowing clubs compete on the
notorious Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. I could not find a
list of *people* who have won this race, as usually
only the club who wins is recorded (because it's a
team sport yadayada posh crap) and I wanted to know
the rowers who won, so yeah, this is my attempt at that.
